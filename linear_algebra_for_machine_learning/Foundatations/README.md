# Introduction to Linear Algebra

- Linear algebra is the mathematics of data.
  - Matrices and vectors are the language of data.
  - SciPy and NumPy, Python's numerical libraries are familiar to anyone.
- Linear algebra has had a marked impact on the field of statistics.
  - Use of vector and matrix notation, especially with multivariate statistics.
  - Solutions to least squares and weighted least squares, such as for linear regression.
  - Estimates of mean and variance of data matrices.
  - The covariance matrix that plays a key role in multinomial Gaussian distributions.
  - Principal component analysis for data reduction that draws many of these elements together.
- Linear algebra underlies many practical mathematical tools, such as Fouries series and computer graphics.



# Linear Algebra and Machine Learning

- Not everyone should learn linear algebra, that it depends where you are in your process of learning machine learning.
  - It’s not required. Having an appreciation for the abstract operations that underly some machine learning algorithms is not required in order to use machine learning as a tool to solve problems.
  - It’s slow. Taking months to years to study an entire related field before machine learning will delay you achieving your goals of being able to work through predictive modeling problems.
  - It’s a huge field. Not all of linear algebra is relevant to theoretical machine learning, let alone applied machine learning.
- 5 Reasons why a deeper understanding of linear algebra is required for intermediate machine learning practitioners.
  - Linear algebra is the mathematics of data and the notation allows you to describe operations on data precisely with specific operators. You need to be able to read and write this notation.
  - You need to know how to add, subtract, and multiply scalars, vectors, and matrices.
  - Statistics and data analysis are another pillar field of mathematics to support machine learning. They are primarily concerned with describing and understanding data. As the mathematics of data, linear algebra has left its fingerprint on many related fields of mathematics, including statistics.
  -  You need to know how to factorize a matrix and what it means. Matrix factorization is a key tool in linear algebra and used widely as an element of many more complex operations in both linear algebra (such as the matrix inverse) and machine learning (least squares).
  - You need to know how to use matrix factorization to solve linear least squares. Linear algebra was originally developed to solve systems of linear equations. 
- That linear algebra can be fun if approached in the right way.



# Examples of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning

- The use of linear algebra structures when working with data such as tabular datasets and images.
- Linear algebra concepts when working with data preparation such as one hot encoding and dimensionality reduction.
- The in-grained use of linear algebra notation and methods in sub-fields such as deep learning, natural language processing and recommender systems.
